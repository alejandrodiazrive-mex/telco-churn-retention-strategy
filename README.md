## 🎯 Project Overview
This project examines customer churn patterns for a Telecommunications company using a dataset of 7,000+ records. The goal is to identify high-risk segments and quantify the **Monthly Revenue at Risk** to support data-driven retention strategies.

*This project focuses on exploratory churn analysis and KPI calculation from a junior data analyst perspective.*

## 📈 Key Business Insights

* **The Contract Gap:** Customers on **month-to-month contracts** show a 42.7% churn rate, compared to only 2.8% for two-year contracts. This is the primary driver of instability.
* **High-Value Attrition:** Churned customers generate an average **Monthly Revenue of $74.44**, which is 21% higher than retained customers ($61.27). The company is losing its most profitable segments.
* **Payment Friction:** The **Electronic Check** method is correlated with the highest churn rate, while automated methods (Credit Card/Bank Transfer) show significantly higher retention.

## 🛡️ From Analysis to Action: Risk Scoring System
Instead of just analyzing *past* churn, I implemented a logic-based scoring system (SQL) to identify *current* customers at risk. This allows the retention team to be proactive rather than reactive.

**The "Risk Score" (Scale 1-10) prioritizes customers based on:**
1.  **Contract Type:** Weighted heavily for Month-to-month users (confirmed as #1 churn driver).
2.  **Payment Friction:** Flags customers using "Electronic Check" or manual payments.
3.  **Tenure Vulnerability:** Assigns higher risk to customers in their first 6 months.

*See file: `04_churn_risk_scoring.sql` for the scoring logic.*

## ⚙️ Project Scope & Limitations
* **Timeframe:** Analysis represents a snapshot in time; longitudinal trends (seasonality) are not included.
* **Churn Definition:** Churn is defined as customers who left within the last month.
* **Revenue Logic:** Projections focus on **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)**, not Lifetime Value (LTV).

## 💡 Potential Actions for Stakeholders

1. **Contract Migration:** Encourage the transition from monthly to 1-year contracts through "Loyalty Discounts" applied to the 3rd month.
2. **Automated Billing Incentives:** Offer a one-time credit (e.g., $5 USD) for customers who switch from Electronic Check to Auto-pay.
3. **High-Value Save Desk:** Implement a priority retention team specifically for customers with monthly charges above $70 USD.
